Nothing so far

* v0.5.7

**** Automatically require ~ryo/json~, ~ryo/yaml~
Both files are now required in ~lib/ryo.rb~, so they can be used
without requiring them separately

**** ~Ryo.delete!~ => ~Ryo.delete~
Other than the rename:  ~Ryo.delete~ accepts an ~ancestors~ option,
and by default traverses the entire prototype chain
